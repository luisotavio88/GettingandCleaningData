# Getting and Cleaning Data
My final project of Getting and Cleaning Data Course


Describing run_analysis.R:

1 - Download and unzip data files

2 - Load activity labels + features infos

3 - Loads both the training and test datasets and extract only the data on mean and standard deviation

4 - Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset

5 - Merge training and test sets

6 - Turn activities & subjects into factors

7 - Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the mean value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

My output is the file "tidy.txt"
